    "You will have to deliver your project at the end of the course (deadline to be determined). You have to hand in a presentation (in PDF or Power Point format). It is mandatory to include the following information:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Basic network description of your data (what type of network it is, what does it represent, is it real or synthetically generated, etc). In practice, the result of project phase #1 (finding data).\n",
    "- Basic network statistics of your data (number of nodes, edges, clustering, degree distribution, etc). In practice, the result of project phase #2 (exploratory data analysis).\n",
    "- A clear statement of your research question, the result of project phase #3.\n",
    "- The analysis, results, and interpretation that allow you to answer your research question, the result of project phase #4.\n",
    "You're free to include this in the order you prefer and to add any additional information you deem necessary, but these are the mandatory components.\n",

    "The format of the oral is as follows: the students make a joint presentation followed by group questions. Subsequently the students are having individual examination with additional questions while the rest of the group is outside the room. The length of the oral will be 15 minutes X number of group members plus one -- for instance, a group of 6 will have 105 minutes ((6+1)*15). Which means you have 15 minutes of group exam plus 15 minutes of individual exam each."
